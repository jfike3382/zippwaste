      <p className="title-s pb-3">
        <strong>10. Arbitration</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You and we both agree to resolve disputes related to your use of the
        Services or these Terms (each, a “Claim”) in binding arbitration instead
        of court, except that either party may bring suit in court to enjoin the
        infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Arbitration Definition.</strong> Arbitration does not involve a
        judge or jury. Instead, a neutral person (the “arbitrator”) hears each
        party’s side of the dispute and makes a decision that is finally binding
        on both parties. The arbitrator can award the same relief as a court
        could, including monetary damages. While court review of an arbitration
        award is limited, if a party fails to comply with the arbitrator’s
        decision, then the other party can have the arbitration decision
        enforced by a court.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Individual Basis.</strong> YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIMS WITH
        US SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS,
        REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. WE AGREE TO DO THE SAME, WHETHER
        OR NOT YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION. ACCORDINGLY, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF
        ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A
        DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE
        OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Arbitration Rules.</strong> The arbitration will be
        conducted under the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Consumer
        Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”). The AAA Rules are available at{" "}
        <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling
        1-800-778-7879.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Arbitration Proceeding.</strong> The arbitration will be
        conducted by the AAA or a comparable arbitration body in the event the
        AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration. Payment of all filing,
        administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless the arbitrator finds your Claim frivolous, we’ll pay for all
        filing, administration and arbitrator fees if your Claim is for less
        than $10,000, and we won’t seek our attorneys’ fees and costs if we
        prevail in the arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in writing,
        remotely (e.g., by videoconference), in San Francisco, California,
        United States or at some other location that we both agree to.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin an arbitration proceeding against us, send a letter requesting
        arbitration and describing your Claim to jason.fike@zippwaste.com, 340 S
        Lemon Ave #2143, Walnut, CA 91789, United States. If we request
        arbitration against you we will give you notice at the email address you
        use to grant access to the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>30 Days Right to Opt-Out.</strong> If you don’t want to agree to
        arbitrate your Claims as explained above, then you can opt-out of this
        arbitration agreement by notifying us of your decision in writing at
        jason.fike@zippwaste.com, and physical notice at 340 S Lemon Ave #2143,
        Walnut, CA 91789, United States. You must opt-out within 30 days of the

        </p>
        <p>
          We collect personal information when you provide it to us, when you

          profile photo.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your Communications with us. </strong>We collect personal

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payment Information.</strong>We may sell services through our
          Services. When you make purchases through the Services, we may use a
          third-party application to process your payments. These third-party
          applications may collect certain financial information from you to
          process a payment on behalf of Zippwaste, including your name, email
          address, mailing address, payment card information, and other billing
          information. Zippwaste does not store or receive your payment
          information, but it may store and receive information associated with
          your payment information (e.g., your billing details).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Surveys. </strong>We may contact you to participate in
          surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Customer Service, Training and Quality Assurance. </strong>
          If you call or otherwise interact with Zippwaste sales, customer
          service or support personnel, we may collect the information you
          provide to our representatives. In addition, we may record telephone

          <strong>B. Information Collected Automatically</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Automatic Data Collection. </strong>We may collect certain
          information automatically when you use the Services. This information
          may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC
          address, cookie identifiers, mobile advertising and other unique
          identifiers, details about your browser, operating system or device,
          location information (inferred based off of your IP address), Internet
          service provider, pages that you visit before, during and after using
          the Services, information about the links you click, and information
          about how you interact with and use the Services.

          <strong>
            Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information.{" "}
          </strong>
          We, as well as third parties that may provide content, advertising, or
          other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags,
          local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to
          automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies
          are essentially small data files placed on your device that allow us
          and our partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you
          visit or interact with our Services.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cookies: </strong>Cookies are small text files placed in
            device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you
            to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services
            may not work properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons: </strong>A pixel tag (also known as
            a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that
            collects information about engagement on the Services. The use of a
            pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited
            a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We
            may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether
            messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Analytics: </strong>We may also use third-party service
          providers to collect and process analytics and other information on
          our Services. These third-party service providers may use cookies,
          pixel tags, web beacons or other storage technology to collect and
          store analytics and other information. They have their own privacy
          policies addressing how they use the analytics and other information
          and we do not have access to, nor control over, third parties’ use of
          cookies or other tracking technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enterprise Customers. </strong>If you use our Services on
          behalf of an organization (e.g., your employer), that organization may
          provide us with information about you so that we can provision your
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Third Party Services and Organizations. </strong>We may obtain
          information about you from other sources, including through
          third-party services and organizations. For example, if you access our
          Services through a third-party application, such as a social
          networking site or a third-party login service, we may collect
          information about you from that third party that you have made
          available via your privacy settings.

          We may add a <strong>tracking pixel</strong> to the body of emails
          sent through our service to track email opens and wrap your links with
          a tracking domain to track link clicks. We use the data acquired
          through these tracking methods to maintain email campaign operability
          and provide campaign reports.

      <h2 className="title-s mt-8">4. AI Co-Creator and Generated Content</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>AI-Generated Content. </strong>
        Stroke uses an AI co-creator to assist you in generating content, such
        as text and images (&quot;Generated Content&quot;). Stroke assigns to
        you all of our right, title, and interest in and to any Generated
        Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that Generated
        Content is created automatically by machine learning technology and may
        be similar to or the same as Generated Content provided to other users,
        and no rights to any Generated Content generated, provided, or returned
        by the Service for or to other users are granted to you under these
        Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limitations of AI Co-Creator.</strong> You acknowledge that the
        AI co-creator has limitations due to its automated nature, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It may contain errors or misleading information;</li>
        <li>
          It lacks the ability to think creatively, understand nuances of
          language (e.g., slang, idioms, cultural references), or convey
          emotions, which may result in repetitive, formulaic, or out-of-context
          content;
        </li>
        <li>
          It may perpetuate biases present in the data used to train it, which
          can result in content that is discriminatory or offensive;
        </li>
        <li>
          It may struggle with complex tasks requiring reasoning, judgment, or
          decision-making;
        </li>
        <li>
          The quality of Generated Content depends on the data used to train the
          AI, which may be of poor quality or biased;
        </li>
        <li>
          Generated Content may lack the personal touch of human-created
          content, making it seem impersonal.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You agree that you are responsible for evaluating and bearing all risks
        associated with the use of any Generated Content, including its
        accuracy, completeness, or usefulness. GENERATED CONTENT IS PROVIDED
        &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.

      <p>
        <strong>User Content.</strong> Any data, text, images, or other
        materials that you submit, upload, or otherwise provide to the Service
        (collectively, &quot;User Content&quot;) are used to provide Generated
        Content to you unless you allow Stroke to use such User Content to
        improve and enhance the Service, including for training AI models, and
        for other development, diagnostic, and corrective purposes in connection
        with the Service and other Stroke offerings. If you enable &quot;Privacy
        Mode&quot; in the Service settings, User Content is transmitted only to
        generate Generated Content in real-time and is deleted once Generated
        Content is generated. When Privacy Mode is enabled, User Content is not
        used for any other purpose, including the training of AI models.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Usage Data.</strong> Stroke, Inc. may collect, generate, and
        derive performance, analytical, or usage data relating to your access to
        or use of the Service (“Usage Data”). Usage Data will not include any
        User Content. Stroke will only use Usage Data to provide the Service to
        you, to monitor the performance and stability of the Service, and to
        prevent or address technical issues with the Service. Stroke may also
        anonymize Usage Data, aggregate it with other data, and use that
        aggregated, anonymized data to improve its products and services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Responsibility for User Content.</strong> You agree that you are
        solely responsible for all your User Content submitted, created, or
        edited through the Service, including Generated Content created with the
        assistance of the AI co-creator. You acknowledge that Generated Content
        may not always be accurate, and you are responsible for reviewing and
        ensuring its appropriateness and compliance with applicable laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ownership of User Content.</strong> You retain all ownership
        rights in your User Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>License.</strong> You grant us a royalty-free, perpetual,

        and improve the Service, including for training AI models (unless

        identified in our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. You
        represent and warrant that you have the right to grant these rights and
        licenses. Without such rights and licenses, you acknowledge that we will
        not be able to provide the Service to you, and you will no longer be
        able to access or use the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Removal of Provided Content.</strong> Stroke may remove your
        User Content for any reason, including if such User Content violates
        these Terms or applicable law.

    <section className="rich-text-section" id="arbitration">
      <h2 className="title-s mt-8">11. Arbitration</h2>
      <p>
        You and we both agree to resolve disputes related to your use of the
        Service or these Terms (each, a “Claim”) in binding arbitration instead
        of court, except that either party may bring suit in court to enjoin the
        infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Arbitration Definition.</strong> Arbitration does not involve a
        judge or jury. Instead, a neutral person (the “arbitrator”) hears each
        party’s side of the dispute and makes a decision that is finally binding
        on both parties. The arbitrator can award the same relief as a court
        could, including monetary damages. While court review of an arbitration
        award is limited, if a party fails to comply with the arbitrator’s
        decision, then the other party can have the arbitration decision
        enforced by a court.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Individual Basis.</strong> YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIMS WITH
        US SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS,
        REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. WE AGREE TO DO THE SAME, WHETHER
        OR NOT YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION. ACCORDINGLY, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF
        ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A
        DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE,
        OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Arbitration Rules.</strong> The arbitration will be
        conducted under the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Consumer
        Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”). The AAA Rules are available at{" "}
        <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling
        1-800-778-7879.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Arbitration Proceeding.</strong> The arbitration will be
        conducted by the AAA or a comparable arbitration body in the event the
        AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration. Payment of all filing,
        administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless the arbitrator finds your Claim frivolous, we’ll pay for all
        filing, administration and arbitrator fees if your Claim is for less
        than $10,000, and we won’t seek our attorneys’ fees and costs if we
        prevail in the arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in writing,
        remotely (e.g., by videoconference), in San Francisco, California,
        United States or at some other location that we both agree to.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin an arbitration proceeding against us, send a letter requesting
        arbitration and describing your Claim to hello@stroke.so, 1606 Headway
        Cir STE 9794, Austin, Texas 78754, United States. If we request
        arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address
        you use to access the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>30 Days Right to Opt-Out.</strong> If you don’t want to agree to
        arbitrate your Claims as explained above, then you can opt-out of this
        arbitration agreement by notifying us of your decision in writing at
        hello@stroke.so, and physical notice at 1606 Headway Cir STE 9794,
        Austin, Texas 78754, United States. You must opt-out within 30 days of

        of these Terms of Service on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of
        any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any
        particular provision of these Terms of Service is held invalid or
